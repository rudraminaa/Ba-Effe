# About the design

The textbook meaning of _effervescence_ is
> The state of being active, positive, and full of energy. It also refers to bubbles rising in a fluid.

The design's core idea is __"Rising Energy"__. The bottom is chaotic and showcases raw, unfiltered energy, while the top widens into calmer strokes symbolizing scale and grand celebration.

The design also resembles a _"vortex"_, representing cultural diversity coming together at a single point.

The top has three wide strokes resembling the letter __"E"__, the first letter of _Effervescence_.

The design is simplistic, giving it a minimalist and modern feel that aligns with the college's technical vibe. It's easy to recognize and remember because it is a simple zig-zag stroke.

The design is theme neutral. It can adapt to any theme, by changing stroke style and colour palette.

It looks good at all sizes.
